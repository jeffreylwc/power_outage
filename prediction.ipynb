    "In this dataset which contains major power outage data from the US from 2000 through 2016, the characteristics of major outages are analyzed and a model is created using pipelines and lienar regression to predict the severity of a major power outage. The duration of time of major power outages is used as the target variable for predicting based on other columns in the data given such as the climate and the amount of customers affected. This prediction is a regression problem since predicting the duration of time is quantitative and so the objective would be to minimize the root-mean squared error (RMSE). The goal is to have a final model with a lower RMSE than the baseline model. The f1-score would not be an appropriate measure for accuracy for this model because it would be nearly impossible to predict the exact continuous values without transforming the duration column into categorical data, where each category is a range of values. Therefore, the f1-score is not used in this model."

    "For the baseline model, five columns are chosen and therefore five features are included to try to predict the duration of major power outages including: 'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED', 'DEMAND.LOSS.MW', 'CLIMATE.CATEGORY', 'CLIMATE.REGION', and 'MONTH'. The two numerical categories, 'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED' and 'DEMAND.LOSS.MW', are both like 'OUTAGE.DURATION' in that they relate to the extent of outages. The other three categories are all categorical, so one-hot encoding was used for each. The 'MONTH' column was one-hot encoded instead of using ordinal encoding since the month December does not have a larger magnitude than January based on month alone. The RMSE and R^2 values are useful predictors for the performance of this model. The goal is to find the highest R^2 value and the lowest RMSE to find the measure of the differences between nominal values of the predicted data and the test data."

    "For the model selection of the final model, train-test split was used as it randomizes the data that is used to avoid biases and it helps train the model as accurately as possible. Principal component analysis (PCA) and standard scaler were used on the two additional features to help the model perform better. PCA was used to minimize potential correlation between the different components and to explain as much variance in the outcome variable as possible. Standard scaler was used for the numerical columns to account for the outliers (0 and extremely large numbers) which may skew the data that are to be evaluated. While these two features did noticeably improve the model, the model still had a lower prediction score which is likely due to the fact that the duration of a power outage is dependent on many other factors such as the availability of mechanics to fix the outage and the complexity of the electrical grids, which are not included in the dataset. A power outage could be longer because there is not as much manpower to fix the outage. "

    "For the fairness evaluation, the months when the major power outages occur are investigated for their effect on the prediction. With RMSE as the parity measure, the goal is to get the least amount of error as possible. If one model has a higher RMSE than the other, then the model is biased towards the first subset. Permutation test is also used to see the difference between months. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the fall months and the other months; all months are equal. On the other hand, the alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference between fall months and other months.  "
